PLUME Python is a Python package that allows you to load and extract data from PLUME record files. The package also comes with a set of utilities to simplify the conversion of the data into more commonly used formats in data analysis like pandas dataframe or CSV files. Embedded data such as LabStreamingLayer's samples can be exported to XDF files for external use in tools such as SigViewer, EEGLAB or MoBILAB.
