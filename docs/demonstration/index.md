# Walkthrough the PLUME Toolbox

## The Easter Egg Hunt Experiment
*Easter Egg Hunt* is a Unity Project for a VR application based on OpenXR and the XR Interaction Toolkit. In this VR game, users are immerged in a house and are tasked to find as much Easter Eggs as they can in under 2 minutes. They need to explore the entire house and interact with their environment to uncover the 25 hidden eggs.

## PLUME Toolbox
To understand the behavior of users roaming inside the Easter Egg Hunt environment, the PLUME toolbox will be our best ally !

* [PLUME Recorder](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Recorder), our comprehensive recorder plugin for Unity is imported within the Easter Egg Hunt project to collect every data we need.
* [PLUME Viewer](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Viewer), our interactive player for XR data will be used to get an overview of our experiment sessions in situ.
* [PLUME Python](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Python), our Python API will be used to explore recorded data and compute insightful metrics.
