# Replay

## Introduction

To replay a record file produced by the [PLUME Recorder](../recorder/index.md), you will need your record `.plm` file along with the [asset bundle](../recorder/asset-bundle.md) associated to the project.

1. Launch PLUME Viewer.
2. Select the `.plm` file you want to replay.

    !!! tip
        You can associate the .plm file extension to `PLUME-Viewer.exe` to quickly open record files in the viewer.

3. Select the associated `plume_bundle.zip` file.

    !!! tip
        By default, the viewer will look for the asset bundle next to the record file. By placing the `plume_bundle.zip` in the same folder as the .plm files, the viewer will not ask for it when opening a record.

4. The player will now start loading the assets and your record file for replay.

The following video showcases a quick replay of a record file from the [*Easter Egg Hunt* demo](../demonstration/index.md) in the PLUME Viewer:
