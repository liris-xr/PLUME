# Installation

!!! info
    If you want to try PLUME on a sample project, you can use the [Easter Egg Hunt demo](https://www.github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Demo).

The viewer is a standalone application, decoupled from any project files, that can be installed on any Windows 10 or later machine.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or later

## From the GitHub releases üì¶ **(Recommended)**

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Viewer/releases).

<div class="center-h flex-column">
<img src="../images/github_releases.png" alt="github releases" width="600"/><br/>
<img src="../images/latest_release.png" alt="github latest release" width="600"/>
</div>

Unzip the `PLUME-Viewer.zip` file and locate the `PLUME-Viewer.exe` executable. This is the main executable file of the PLUME Viewer that will be used to open and visualize the records.

<div class="center-h">
