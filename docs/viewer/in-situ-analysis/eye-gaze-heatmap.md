# Eye gaze heatmap (Experimental ðŸ§ª)

!!! warning "Experimental feature"
    The eye-gaze heatmap is an experimental feature. It is still under development and may present some artifacts.

With the eye-gaze module, you can create heatmaps that show where the user looked at the most. In pratice, the direction of gaze is projected from the position of the eyes in a cone-shaped perspective towards the objects in the scene. The heatmap is bound to the objects, it takes into account occlusions and the dynamic nature of the scene.

The eye-gaze heatmap analysis module contains the following parameters:

* XR Camera: GUID of the Main Camera object.
* Projection Receiver: GUID of one or more object for the heatmap to be projected on.
* Include children: if enabled, the projection will include the GUID inserted in 'Projection Receiver' and their children in the hierarchy.
* Coordinate System: Tracking Space or Head Space. OpenXR doesn't push a standard for the coordinate system used by HMDs eye-tracker. Depending on your headset, recorded eye-gaze will have a different coordinate system (eg. Meta Quest Pro uses `Tracking Space`; HTC Vive Pro Eye uses `Head Space`).
* Time Range: section of the record you want the heatmap to be computed on. Leave as is to take the entire record into account.

Click on `Generate` to create the interaction eye-gaze heatmap with selected parameters. Once computed, objects that have been gazed at directly will be highlighted. Dark blue means no gaze, Dark Red means most time spent gazing at this zone.

Generated heatmaps can be hidden from view (using eye icon) or deleted (using trash icon).
