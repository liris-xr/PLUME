# Metadata (WIP)

Metadata is an important part of the data recording process to ensure reproducibility of experiments. For now, the recorder only records basic metadata such as the version of the recorder, the start time of the record since epoch, the name of the record, and explicitely defined extra metadata.

!!! note
    We are planning on adding automatic metadata recording for important data such as the hardware used, the Unity version, etc. If you have any suggestions or ideas on important metadata to record, feel free to [contribute](../../../contributing.md).
