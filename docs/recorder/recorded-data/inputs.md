# Inputs

The `InputSystemRecorderModule` record inputs from the actions assets listed in the [XRITK input action manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/input-action-manager.html). For a classic XRITK installation, this includes all the controllers inputs such as triggers, buttons, and so on.

The proto specification documentation for the input samples can be found [here](../file-format/proto-files/unity/xritk/input_action.md). 

!!! info
    The `InputSystemRecorderModule` is still in development and will be improved in the future, starting by decoupling the recorder from the XRITK input action manager.
