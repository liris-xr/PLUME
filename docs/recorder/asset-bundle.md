# Asset bundle

In order to share a record without having to send the full Unity project, you can use an asset bundle. An asset bundle is a file that contains all the assets needed to replay a record in the [PLUME Viewer](../viewer/index.md). The asset bundle include prefabs, textures, materials, meshes, etc that were used in the scenes listed in the build settings of the project.

## Exporting an asset bundle

Asset bundles can be exported from the menu `PLUME > Build Asset Bundle`. The generated asset bundle will be saved as `Assets/AssetBundles/plume_bundle.zip`.
