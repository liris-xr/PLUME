## Unity throws an error when installing PLUME Recorder
* Please check the version of your Unity Editor, and make sure it is newer than 2022.3

## Building my application fails
* Unity Editor can sometimes include a file in the build that cannot be accessed. Usually closing the Unity Editor, and start the build right after reopening solves this issue.
