# Introduction

PLUME is a software toolbox that allows for the exhaustive record of XR behavioral data (including synchronous physiological signals), their offline interactive replay and analysis. PLUME is composed of three main tools:

* [PLUME Recorder](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Recorder) for recording data from any Unity applications.
* [PLUME Viewer](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Viewer) for replaying records and in-situ analysis.
* [PLUME Python](https://github.com/liris-xr/PLUME-Python) for ex-situ analysis.

The following guide will help you get started with PLUME by recording your first experiment, reviewing it in the viewer and analyzing the data.
