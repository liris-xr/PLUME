    "# Ex-situ analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex-situ analysis is the process of analyzing the data outside of the 3D context. For example to perform statistical analysis, machine learning, or to integrate the data in more traditional workflows. For this task, we provide PLUME Python, a Python package that allows you to load and extract data from PLUME record files. The package also comes with a set of utilities to simplify the conversion of the data into more commonly used formats in data analysis like pandas dataframe or CSV files. Embedded data such as LabStreamingLayer's samples can be exported to XDF files for external use in tools such as SigViewer, EEGLAB or MoBILAB."
